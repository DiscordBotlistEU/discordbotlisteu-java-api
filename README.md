# Discord-Botlist.eu API for Java.
An easy-to-use API to post your servercount to [discord-botlist.eu](https://discord-botlist.eu/).

## How to use
``` 
DiscordBotlistApi dblApi = new DiscordBotlistApi("yourbotstokenhere");
dblApi.post(servercount);
```

that's it.

## Important Information
I'm currently working on an update for the API since the old endpoints were shut down due to an update to the API itself.
